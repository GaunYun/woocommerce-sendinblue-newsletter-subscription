SendinBlue 
== Description ==
The all-in-one Marketing Add-on for WooCommerce users.
Design, send and track automatic emails / SMS for your customers. 

> <strong>Why Email marketing is so important for WooCommerce users?</strong><br>
> WooCommerce includes some confirmation emails, but these emails are not easy to change, and above all, you don't have any statistics on email deliverability, open and click rate. SendinBlue Add-on allows you to improve deliverability, get full statistics, and deploy effective email / SMS campaigns.

= Confirmation emails - Deliverability =
SendinBlue Add-on allows you to use a professional SMTP to send your WooCommerce confirmation emails. By using SendinBlue SMTP, you ensure that all your confirmation emails arrive in your customers' inboxes. 

= Confirmation emails - Statistics =
Once you configured SendinBlue Add-on to send WooCommerce emails, you will get full statistics on your emails. Choose a custom time period, and you will get for each email template (new order, processing order, etc.) the number of emails sent, the deliverability, open and click rate. You can get extra statistics, for example the number of clicks on each link, by logging on SendinBlue. 

= Confirmation Text messages =
Text messages are powerful marketing tools. SendinBlue Add-on allows you to send confirmation SMS after specific events in order life cycle: order confirmation and order shipment. You can customize the message by inserting the first name, last name, order price or order date. You can get full SMS statistics after logging on SendinBlue.   

= Subscription options =
If enabled, all customers will be added to the list you choose after order creation or order completion. You can choose to display or not an opt-in field on checkout, if so, you can define the opt-in field label, for example "Add me to newsletter", and decide whether the checkbox is checked or not by default. You can also activate the "Double Opt-in" feature to invite customers to confirm their subscription. 

= Email & SMS campaigns =
In a few clicks, you can send a SMS message to all your customers, or all your subscribed customers, directly from WooCommerce settings. As for SMS confirmation, you can personalize SMS with dynamic information, and you can test your campaign by sending a test SMS.To send email campaigns, please log in your sendinble account from sendinblue.com.
